                        <li>
                        It's been a while since I last built a webpage. My previous experience stemmed from a highschool introductory class to web development. The main problem I had on this specific assignment was my first experience with git and github, learning how to use a VCS. Since it was my first time using git and github, it took a couple hours for me to learn how to 
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                            clone a respository
                                </li>
                                <li>edit
                                </li>
                                <li>commit
                                </li>
                                <li>push
                                </li>
                            </ul>files onto github. I first attemped to clone the assignment to a local respository on my laptop, but then later realized it was much easier to just use the engr server as a local respository, so that I could not only work on the assignment on my laptop but also my desktop computer aswell.

                        <li> 
                        Since I've had some exposure to HTML and CSS in highschool, I'm familiar with most of the basics such as 
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                headers
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                paragraphs
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                unordered lists and orders lists
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                color's for body and headers
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    text-alignment
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    word-spacing
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    text-indent
                                </li>
                            </ul>However there are many things I'm still not familiar with, so a good resource I used to help me with this assignment was <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp">HTML Element Reference</a> , a website page that helps list and describe the functions of each of the html tags.

                        <li>
                        Recently we've been given a CSS assignment, where we're supposed to mock and replicate how a particular website looks.
                        We are accountable for creating a Cascading Style Sheet, that's responsible for styling the aesthetic
                        side of the website. In this assignment in particular, I had a rough time understanding 
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                specificity
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                where/how to apply features to certain elements. (Because I was applying specificity incorrectly)
                                </li>
                                <li>

                        <li>
                        In order to understand specificity better, where/how to apply features to certain elements, and how to correctly
                        apply flex to elements, I went to visit my TA, Ujjval for help. He was really insightful, providing me with the knowledge
                        needed to utilize specificity more accurately, where and how to apply features to certain elements through specificity,
                        and how to correctly apply flex to elements.

                        In this current assignment I've been tasked to create a search filter for filtering out searches that
                        fit the criteria of the user's specific inputs. I'm also tasked with creating new posts and utilizing
                        the modal as appropriate. While working on this assignment, I was struggling to complete the filtering search functionality.
                        specifically I was struggling with

                        To gain a better undersanding, I went to Ujjval for help understanding how to 
                        create new post and utilize the modal as required. I Learned how to effiecently store and access multiple variables
                        by creating an object array to hold those values.

                        <li>
                        This assignment was surprisingly light in my opinion. I initially had doubts that I would be able to complete this assignment
                        within a week, but over the course of the weekend I was able to get just about everything with this assingment done. The only problems
                        I ran into that I couldn't solve over the weekend was,
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                Trying to display a status code of 404 to non-existing pages, while redirecting
                                them to the 404.html page
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                Making sure I was calling the existing pages from memory rather than from the hard disk
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                        In order to complete these requirements, I visit my TA Ujjval who was very helpful informing me of better
                        approaches to trying to display status code of 404 to non-existing pages, while at the same time redirecting them
                        to the 404.html page. As I was unsure if I was calling the existing pages correctly from memory rather than the hard disk, 
                        I then proceeded to talk to my professor Rob Hess after class to receive feedback/suggestions or confirmation that I was
                        going about the assignment correctly. Luckily for me, he took a look at my code and explained to me how I'm incorrectly using
                        the readFile variables. Because the readFile variables I placed within the createServer function, are reading the files
                        everytime I load a page, instead of reading it once. So he suggested I place the variables outside of the createServer function,
                        so that the program will only need to read the files once.
                        </li>

                        <h2><em><strong>Templating a website</strong></em></h2>
                        <li>
                        This assignment does a great job bringing all the elments from the past assignments and incorporating what we learned from those
                        assignments, into this one. This particular assignment had us focus on templating a website using handlebars. Initially working
                        with express in assignment #4 leveraged us in this one, letting us directly apply what we learning about using express and connecting
                        the client to the server, using node.js. There are so many things ranging from handlebars, to partials, templating, json, and routing
                        that I thought made this assignment the most fun to play around with. We all got to create our first own working website using handlebars,
                        templating, and using data from a encoded json file, from client to server and vice versa.
                            
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>
                        I thought this assignment was pretty straightforward and aligning with the lecture, so it was relatively moderate in terms of difficulty. 
                        It did require a lot of module installations for packages such as  
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    express
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    express-handlebars
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    npm modules
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>
                            The only problem I had difficulty completing was the single posts, I was banging my head for several good hours googling, sifting through
                            the handlebars, server.js and index.js files trying to debug why or how to fix the implementation of single post. To complete this
                            assignment I went to my TA Ujjval and my teacher Rob Hess for more insight as to how to correctly implement only a single post.
