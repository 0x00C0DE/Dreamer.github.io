            Hello everyone, my name is Braden.
            </li>
            <li>
            To contact me, my email is ______________.

            I'm currenty majoring in computer science, and I'm junior.

        On a scale from 0 to 10, I feel like I am at a 4. I've seen and been exposed to coding the mere basics for 		   a personal html webpage using html and CSS, for previous assignments in highschool. But I feel the experience I had was not nearly enough to be able to code a professional looking website.

        I hope to learn how to create aesthetic website navigation bars, and how to incorporate api's into websites.

        Back when I just turned 18, I wanted to do something for myself for becoming a legal adult. So I bought 18 lottery tickets of each, the powerball, mega millions, and Oregon's game mega bucks. A little later when the drawing time came around, I found out I won $100.
